        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>Bio:</h4>
        <p>I was born and raised in a small town in North East North Carolina. Since a youth, i've always had an interest in tech but I never thought to make a career out of it. I've worked in a variety of fields such as warehouses, sales, customer service, and even insurance. Although I've gained impeccable soft skills, I never got to fully imerse myself into tech.</p>
